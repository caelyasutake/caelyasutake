      <description>Evolving Soft Robots to walk via Genetic Programming is a current project exploring the process of synthetic evolution with the hopes of finding innovative locomotion techniques.&#xA;I created a custom physics simulator using C++, Swift, and Apple&amp;rsquo;s Metal Shading Language to perform graphics rendering and calculations. This is a current project however, and I am currently in the process of transitioning the genetic program rendering from Matplotlib to Apple Metal GPU.</description>

      <title>AI Capture the Flag</title>

      <description>AI Capture the Flag is a multi-objective reinforcement learning experiment understanding the interactions between multiple agents in the same environment, involving teamwork and cooperation.&#xA;Each team consists of three agents that will work together to capture the opposing team&amp;rsquo;s flag located on the other side of the arena. Agents must grapple between two objectives, capturing the flag and not letting the opponents capture theirs.&#xA;We can see here that in one epoch, the red team chooses to go for the flag, while in the other epoch they choose to defend against the blue agents.</description>

      <description>Hello! I&amp;rsquo;m Cael Yasutake, a third-year Computer Science student from Columbia University. Some of my academic interests include Robotics, AI, and Mathematics. When I&amp;rsquo;m not staring at my computer screen, I love learning dance choreographies, playing chess, and watching football. Industry Experience Last year I worked with General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT) as an Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning intern.&#xA;Programming I&amp;rsquo;m interested in Reinforcement Learning, Game Development, and Computer Graphics.</description>
