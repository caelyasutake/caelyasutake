      <description>AI Capture the Flag is a multi-objective reinforcement learning experiment understanding the interactions between multiple agents in the same environment, involving teamwork and cooperation.&#xA;Each team consists of three agents that will work together to capture the opposing team&amp;rsquo;s flag located on the other side of the arena. Agents must grapple between two objectives, capturing the flag and not letting the opponents capture theirs.&#xA;We can see here that in one epoch, the red team chooses to go for the flag, while in the other epoch they choose to defend against the blue agents.</description>
